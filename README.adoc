== Reserve Proxies with  Apache HTTP
This Repo examines the features  of mod_proxy_html and mod_subsdtitute in Apache httpd. To start the enviroment just start the compose file.


.Bash Snippet to start the Environment
[source,bash]
----
chmod +x startDefaults.sh 
./startDefaults.sh
----

TIP: Chrome resolves localhost subdomains out of the box (firefox does not )


== Lessons I learned: 

* mod-proxy only rewrites headers, nothing else
* mod_proxy_html only rewrites attributes of tags, which it is configured to do so (https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_html.html)
* mod_proxy_html can additional rewrite inline scripts and stylesheets but no inline styles from other tags
* external scripts & stylesheets can be rewritten with mod substitute
